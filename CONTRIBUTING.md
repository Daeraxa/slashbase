## Setup Development Environment

To contribute code to the repository, you need to setup the development environment. To do that, you can follow the following steps:

1. Clone or Fork-Clone the GitHub repo and open it in your preferred IDE (VS-Code recommended).
2. Go to the project root directory and
    - Copy the file at `frontend/.env.local.txt` and paste as `frontend/.env.local`.
    - Copy the file at `development.env.sample` and paste as `development.env` in the root directory of the project.
    - Edit `development.env` file and update the root user email and password.
3. (Optional if you have postgresdb already running. If yes, just update the enviroment variables and skip this step) You need docker installed on your desktop, follow [this link](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) to install. Open terminal at the project root directory and run `docker-compose up`. It starts postgresdb at port 6543.
4. Open terminal at the project root directory & run `go run main.go` to run go backend server & `cd frontend & yarn dev` to run frontend nextjs server. Go server is running at `http://localhost:3001` & Frontend client at `http://localhost:3000`
5. Create a new branch and make changes to the code.
6. Test and make sure the code runs
7. Push your code and send PR.
