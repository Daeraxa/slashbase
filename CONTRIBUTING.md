## Setup Development Environment

To contribute code to the repository, you need to setup the development environment. To do that, you can follow the following steps:

1. Clone or Fork-Clone the GitHub repo and open it in your preferred IDE (VS-Code recommended).
2. You need docker installed on your desktop, follow [this link](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) to install.
3. Go to the project root directory and
    - Copy the file at `frontend/.env.local.txt` and paste as `frontend/.env.local`
    - Copy the file at `src/config/development.yaml.txt` and paste as `src/config/development.yaml`
    - Edit `src/config/development.yaml` file and update the root user email and password.
5. Open terminal at the project root directory and run `docker-compose up`. Once it starts, server is running at `http://localhost:3001` & Client at `http://localhost:3000`
7. Create a new branch and make changes to the code.
